                <h2>Early Life</h2>
                <p>I grew up in Carmel Valley, San Diego, California. I played competitive soccer for SDSC Surf and DMCL Sharks. Being a team captain for a competitive team sport taught me a lot about leadership, accountability, teamwork, and management. All of these traits have correlated into my every day life and help me with all of my decision making. Although I stopped playing competitive soccer, it is still my favorite sport to play for fun and exercise.</p>
                <p>Growing up, I have always been involved in the car community. Cars have been my biggest passion and hobby for my entire life. I love seeing cool cars, watching crazy car builds, following motorsports/Formula 1, and driving cars. My passion for cars is what made me start my own auto detailing business and pursue a career in the automotive industry. I hope to one day own my own car company for designing, tuning, and building crazy custom builds.</p>

                <h2>Future Goals</h2>
                <p>I am looking for any opportunity after college to further learn and gain real world experience. My dedication to continue learning is life long and I will be a valuable asset to any team I am part of.</p>
                <p>In the near future I want to be involved in the automotive industry, either mechanically or technologically. My passion for cars aligns me perfectly for working with car as a career. Whether it's fixing an engine or coding the ECU, I will be the perfect person.</p>
                <p>My dream is to begin my own automotive business and become a legacy in the car community. I want to make a name and a brand for myself bringing people the highest quality designs, tunes, and builds. Current companies that inspire my dream are Gintani, Liberty Walk, Shelby America, DDE.</p>
